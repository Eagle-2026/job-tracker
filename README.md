Hey there! 👋 This is my Job Tracker project — a full-stack web app I built to help users keep track of their job applications, manage their dashboard, and stay organized during the job hunt.

I built this project with a focus on React, Next.js, and modern front-end tools. It's also my first project where I practiced writing tests for components.

## Features
- Add, view, and manage your job applications
- User authentication with Auth.js
- Dynamic dashboard for easy tracking
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Form validation using React Hook Form
- Data fetching and state management with React Query

## Tech Stack
- Next.js – for server-side rendering and routing
- React – for building interactive UI components
- React Hook Form – for handling forms easily with validation
- React Query – for fetching and managing server state
- Auth.js / NextAuth – for user authentication
- Jest & Testing Library – for testing components

## How I Tested It
I wrote some basic tests to show I can:
- Render forms and input fields correctly
- Type into form fields
- Check if navbar displays correct links based on authentication

This helped me practice unit testing and get more confident with React component testing.
